# Component List

The following is a list and explanation of the technologies running in our project. Each of these components is running in a docker container within a docker compose project. 

Main Server
Minecraft Server
Purpose: To have a live server and application running to produce real time logs and system information rather than developing a fully synthetic application. 

Data Management
Kafka
Purpose: Serving as the message queue for log messages from the minecraft server. 
Usage: A python producer script pushes log information in real time from the minecraft container and into a Kafka Topic. Using an exporter for Kafka the data in the topic is then sent to MongoDB
Available on: http://localhost:9092
MongoDB
Purpose: To ingest server logs from Kafka and store the raw data in a series of documents.
Usage: Via an exporter for Kafka data from a topic is pushed into a mongoDB collection and stored for later use.
Available on: http://localhost:27017 
SQL
Purpose: To store processed log information from MongoDB in a relational manner, creating a summary of the data
Usage: Via a pymongo script raw log data stored in documents in Mongo is formatted to be stored in SQL. 

System Monitoring
cAdvisor
Purpose: To expose system metrics from all the containers in the environment. Tracks various performance metrics of all the containers (CPU/ Memory usageâ€¦)
Usage: Used by Prometheus to gather system performance data exposed by the cAdvisor container
Available on: http://localhost:8080
Prometheus
Purpose: To collect metrics exposed by cAdvisor and the Minecraft application in a queryable format for use in other components. Also to manage alerts for containers.
Usage: Used by Grafana to gather information to visualize. Also used to configure and send alerts about issues with container behavior.
Available on: http://localhost:9090
AlertManager
Purpose: To send alerts to a discord webhook when Prometheus rules detect there is an issue with the system.
Usage: Shows alerts that are currently firing. If there is an issue with discord, if you can see the alerts in the alert manager then that means they fired properly.
Available on: http://localhost:9093
Grafana
Purpose: To visualize all monitoring aspects of the system.
Usage: Queries Prometheus to display system information in Time Series Format. You can log in and explore the dashboards.
